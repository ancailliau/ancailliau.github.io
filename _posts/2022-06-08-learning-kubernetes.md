## Learning Kubernetes

Over the years, how we deploy and run applications has vastly changed. Back
at the university, I did not learn about cloud, barely about containers and 
certainly not about Kubernetes. I consider this to be a lack of knowledge
especially as I would like to offer software-as-a-service in the near future. 

I'm mostly developping in C# with .NET Core framework, I'm thereby vastly
biased and focused on running that specific type of software on K8S.

I watched *.NET Microservices – Full Course* on Youtube
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI) by Les Jackson which was an eye
opener. I followed the complete course and re-developped the application along.
You can find all my code on https://github.com/ancailliau/LesJacksonS04E03.

I'm currently reading *Kubernetes in Action* by Marko Lukša
