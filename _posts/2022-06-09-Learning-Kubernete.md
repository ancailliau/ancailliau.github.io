I decided to start diving a lot more into Kubernetes as it appears to become
the standard way of deploying web applications. I have a lot to catch up as
cloud was barely a buzzword when I was a student.

The struggles I hope to fix are:
* Simpler and fully automated deployment
* Simpler updates of standards components such as Postgres, RabbitMQ, Nginx, etc.

I'm also looking into the security aspects as these will likely become
proeminent in the upcoming years. 

Last, I'm interested in the following certifications. I know that some people
find certifications useless but they give an objective to aim at, and they provide
a baseline.

* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
* Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)
