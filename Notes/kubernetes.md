Over the years, how we deploy and run applications has vastly changed. Back
at the university, I did not learn about cloud, barely about containers and 
certainly not about Kubernetes. I consider this to be a lack of knowledge
especially as I would like to offer software-as-a-service in the near future.

I'm mostly developping in C# with .NET Core framework, I'm thereby vastly
biased and focused on running that specific type of software on K8S.

I watched [.NET Microservices – Full
Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI) on Youtube by [Les
Jackson](https://dotnetplaybook.com/) which was an eye opener. I followed the
complete course and re-developped the application along. You can find all my
code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ancailliau/LesJacksonS04E03).

I'm currently reading [Kubernetes in
Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action-second-edition) by
[Marko Lukša](https://twitter.com/markoluksa).
